<h1>  Projects: Creating a Framework for the development of Toolkits for new Species </h1>
<div>
<!--this div will be used for the over all explanation of the broad, over arching aspect of our project.  Here we can discuss the framework we designed,how we applied it, and how it can be applied to other species (THIS MAY WANT TO BE ON THE MAIN PAGE??)-->
	<h2> Main Pursuits </h2>
	<p>
		Blah blah blah we intend to make this for this
	</p>
		<h3>  Development Framework </h3>
		<p> Go into the frame work, explain the steps, give examples.</p>
		<h3> Parts</h3>
		<p> What we ended up actually making, etc. (??) </p>
		<h3> Selected Species </h3>
		<p> Go into why we selected these species, why they are important </p>
		<h3> How this helps IGEM </h3>
		<p> 
		Talk about how this framework and toolkit can help expand the boundaries
		of synthetic biology.  How this work helps IGEM teams expand crucial
		techniques into hundreds of different industrially important species
		and help broaden the scope and power of synthetic biology exponentially.
		Basically, bullshit a lot to sound incredibly helpful and useful, Yay!
		Framework helps establish these techniques... Etc.
